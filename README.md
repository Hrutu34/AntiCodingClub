# 🧠 Anti Coding Club

> _"We hated writing code from scratch — so we built a website without writing any."_  

---

## Overview

**AntiCodingClub** was a small, fun club from our college days — a home for developers who loved tech but disliked starting from a blank file.  
True to the name, the site was created **without writing a single line of code** using **Mobirise**, a drag-and-drop website builder. The generated static site is hosted with **GitHub Pages** and still receives feedback through the contact form.

## Site structure

Top navigation contains 4 pages:

- `index.html` — Home
- `What's New.html` — Announcements and updates
- `Projects.html` — Project showcases
- `Support Us.html` — Feedback / contact (the feedback window is still responsive and delivers messages)

---

## Feedback

The feedback form on **Support Us** is still functional — submitted messages are delivered to the configured endpoint.  
If you plan to move or change the backend that receives messages, check the form attributes and any included scripts generated by Mobirise.

## Tech stack

- **Mobirise** — drag-and-drop site builder (no hand-written code required)
- **HTML / CSS / JS** — auto-generated output from Mobirise
